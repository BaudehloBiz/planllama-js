# Workflow Feature Test Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the new workflow functionality in PlanLlama client library.

## Test Coverage (14 tests, all passing)

### 1. Workflow Definition (5 tests)
- ✅ **Simple workflow with no dependencies**: Verifies basic workflow registration with independent steps
- ✅ **Workflow with dependencies**: Tests dependency declaration using array syntax
- ✅ **Error when not started**: Ensures proper error handling when calling workflow() before start()
- ✅ **Invalid step definition**: Catches non-function, non-array step definitions
- ✅ **Step array without function**: Validates that dependency arrays end with a handler function

### 2. Cycle Detection (4 tests)
Tests the Kahn's algorithm implementation for detecting circular dependencies:

- ✅ **Simple cycle (A → B → A)**: Two-step circular dependency
- ✅ **Three-way cycle (A → C, B → A, C → B)**: More complex circular dependency
- ✅ **Valid DAG with multiple branches**: Allows legitimate diamond dependencies (A → B/C, B/C → D)
- ✅ **Undefined dependency**: Catches references to non-existent steps

### 3. Workflow Execution (3 tests)
- ✅ **Register individual step handlers**: Verifies each step becomes a separate job handler
- ✅ **Execute individual step when triggered**: Tests step execution via work_request events
- ✅ **Pass step results correctly**: Ensures data flows between dependent steps

### 4. Step Result Storage (1 test)
- ✅ **Call storeStepResult after step execution**: Verifies workflow infrastructure is registered

### 5. Error Handling (1 test)
- ✅ **Handle step handler errors gracefully**: Tests error propagation from failed steps

## Key Testing Patterns

### Mocking Strategy
- Uses `mockSocket.mockServerEvent("work_request", job, callback)` to trigger handlers
- Mocks `fetch_step_results` to return cached step results
- Simulates async completion with `setTimeout` for async handlers

### Cycle Detection Validation
```typescript
// Triggers cycle check by executing workflow handler
mockSocket.emit.mockImplementation((event, data, callback) => {
  if (event === "fetch_step_results") {
    callback?.({ status: "ok", stepResults: {} });
  }
});
mockSocket.mockServerEvent("work_request", mockJob, mockCallback);
```

### Step Execution Testing
```typescript
// Each step registered as `${workflowName}/${stepName}`
const mockJob: Job = {
  name: "workflow-name/step1",
  data: { /* step results */ }
};
mockSocket.mockServerEvent("work_request", mockJob, callback);
```

## Integration with Existing Tests
- All 80 tests pass (66 existing + 14 new)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Follows established patterns from `client.test.ts`

## Test Execution
```bash
npm test -- workflow.test.ts  # Run workflow tests only
npm test                       # Run all tests
```

## Coverage Areas

### What's Tested
✅ Workflow definition and validation  
✅ Cycle detection (Kahn's algorithm)  
✅ Step handler registration  
✅ Individual step execution  
✅ Data passing between steps  
✅ Error handling in steps  

### What's NOT Tested (Integration/E2E scope)
❌ Full workflow orchestration (requires server mock for `request()`)  
❌ Step result persistence (requires server-side storage mock)  
❌ Workflow resumption after failure  
❌ Complex multi-level dependency trees  
❌ Concurrent workflow execution  

## Notes
- Tests focus on unit-level validation of workflow mechanics
- Full workflow execution (orchestrator running multiple steps) would require more complex server mocking
- Current tests validate that:
  1. Steps are properly registered as workers
  2. Dependencies are correctly parsed
  3. Cycles are detected before execution
  4. Individual steps execute correctly when triggered

## Future Test Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Full workflow orchestration tests with mocked `send_job` responses
- Performance tests for workflows with many steps
- Tests for workflow state recovery
- Tests for parallel step execution
- Tests for workflow timeout behavior
